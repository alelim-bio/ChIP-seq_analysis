# ChIP-seq Analysis Repository

This repository contains folders with different types of ChIP-seq analysis for various epigenetic modifications. Below is an overview of the contents:

## H3K4me3 Analysis

Folder: [H3K4me3](./H3K4me3)

The H3K4me3 folder focuses on the analysis of ChIP-seq data specifically for the H3K4me3 epigenetic modification. It includes the following components:

- Data Preprocessing: Scripts and pipelines for quality control, adapter trimming, and read alignment.
- Peak Calling: Tools and methods for identifying enriched regions using peak calling algorithms.
- Peak Annotation: Scripts to annotate identified peaks with gene annotations, functional categories, and other genomic features.
- Differential Binding Analysis: Methods for comparing ChIP-seq profiles between different experimental conditions or groups.

## H3K27me3 Analysis

Folder: [H3K27me3](./H3K27me3)

The H3K27me3 folder focuses on the analysis of ChIP-seq data specific to the H3K27me3 epigenetic modification. It includes the following components:

- Data Processing: Scripts and pipelines for preprocessing ChIP-seq data, including read alignment and quality control steps.
- Peak Calling and Filtering: Methods for identifying significant peaks and filtering them based on statistical measures.
- Differential Binding Analysis: Techniques for comparing ChIP-seq profiles between different experimental conditions or groups to identify differentially bound regions.

## Bivalent Analysis

Folder: [Bivalent](./Bivalent)

The Bivalent folder contains analysis workflows for studying the co-occurrence of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modifications, known as bivalent domains. It includes the following components:

- Data Integration: Methods for merging and integrating H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq data.
- Domain Identification: Tools and approaches for identifying bivalent domains and determining their genomic characteristics.
- Functional Analysis: Scripts for exploring the functional implications and enrichment of genes within bivalent domains.

## Additional Resources

Folder: [Resources](./Resources)

The Resources folder contains supplementary materials and resources that can aid in ChIP-seq analysis, including reference genomes, software packages, and relevant literature.

Feel free to explore the respective folders for more detailed information and specific analysis workflows.
