# ChIP-seq_analysis
Examples, details, and insight in ChIP-seq analysis 
## Pipeline overview

**Insert Diagram Here**

### 1. Quality Control (QC) of sequencing and reads


### 2. Read alignment
### 3a. Peak calling
### 3b. Visualization
### 4. Differential analysis

###### Notes.
1. Learning from Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core training and lessons: https://github.com/hbctraining
  * Currently, there are two versions of the ChIP-seq training modules. The recent is the *flipped* variation. However, the flipped training module only accomodates up to Peak calling and analysis. It doesn't explore differential binding analysis. If looking for differential binding analysis. It's best to look into the old HBC ChIP-seq training.
